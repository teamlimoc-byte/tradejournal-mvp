      "psychology": "Managed FOMO better by respecting dead-zone rules and prioritizing process over chasing. Caught myself when hope-based thinking appeared.",
      "ruleAdherence": "Good overall: respected stop, avoided dead-zone override, and made defensive exit decision on extended late-day conditions.",
      "whatWentWell": "Followed A+ checklist more consistently, identified hope-vs-rule distinction in real time, and protected capital during uncertain conditions.",
      "whatToImprove": "Don’t anchor on one signal (e.g., ORB retest) when BOS structure conflicts. Keep execution checklist explicit before entry.",
      "lessonLearned": "“I’ll exit near BE unless reclaim confirms” is rule-based; “maybe it comes back” is hope-based. BOS line/level is context, BOS event is break-confirm action.",
